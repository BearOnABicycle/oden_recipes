        <p>This is a healthy and filling dish that can be served any time of the day, but fits especially well at breakfast. With 8oz of tofu you will get your fill of protein. 
            You can even mix it up by adding more of your favorite veggies. I like to add herlume tomatos and when I'm feeling a little crazy some vegan feta.</p>
